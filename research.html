              <p data-aos="fade-up">Family Included is a project which seeks to help actualize the WHO declaration on family inclusive maternal healthcare; it is carried out by Dad. Info which is a UK based information service for fathers that has
                worked closely with UK maternity and child services for many years, providing them with resources for their own users, both fathers and mother. “WHO has declared family inclusive maternal healthcare to be one of five top global
                priorities, because when families (fathers and others) are included, the health of mother and baby improves.”</p>

              <p data-aos="fade-up"> Last year, WHO published the evidence backing up family-inclusive care. Since then, we have been collating and sharing all new research at FamilyIncluded.com. We have started to develop the Family Included Global
                Alliance, bringing together practitioners and policymakers interested in supporting the “community of care” around each child. It is resourced by a growing body of relevant research and reports on successful approaches all over the
                world.</p><br>
              <p data-aos="fade-up"> We can build this Network in Nigeria, linked into the global network so that Nigerian services can learn from researchers, practitioners and policy makers not just in Nigeria, but everywhere in the world and
                Nigeria can teach others around the world on the basis of its own advances and successes.</p> </br>

              <p data-aos="fade-up"> The project in Nigeria is proposed to include</p><br>
              <ul>
                <li data-aos="fade-up"> Training for professionals so that they become skilled and confident in working with men, couples and groups. These are vital components of family inclusive care, alongside the one-to-one support offered to the
                  mother.</li><br>
                <li data-aos="fade-up"> Information for fathers about the importance of fatherhood for child welfare and how they can become fully engaged, overcoming the structural and cultural barriers that have formed around their role as careers.
                  Also needed is information for mothers and all family members about the important role of fatherhood within the “community of care” that exists around every child.</li><br>
                <li data-aos="fade-up"> Networks for health workers implementing family inclusive care, whereby they can receive advice and support directly and informally from peers. This peer networking is essential in providing continued support
                  beyond start-up and training programmes.</li><br>
                <li data-aos="fade-up"> A forum for policy makers from government and civil society groups, where all aspects family inclusive care can be considered, in particular the common barriers that prevent its development. Previous experience
                  of developing family inclusive care demonstrates that these barriers will become a primary focus of attention as the ideal of family inclusive care is pursued. </li>

              <p> At Childcare and Wellness Clinics, we are dedicated to advancing public health initiatives and ensuring that communities are at the forefront of healthcare delivery. We are proud to announce our collaboration with esteemed organizations such as the International Federation of the Red Cross, Nigeria Red Cross, the University of Geneva and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on a ground-breaking initiative: The PULSE Project.</p> <br>
              <p> The PULSE Project is an innovative research initiative focused on evaluating and enhancing community engagement in vaccine delivery, specifically within humanitarian settings.</p> <br>

                The Implementation Challenge: Expanding the scope of community engagement beyond the moment of vaccine administration.

                The Evidence Challenge: Addressing the gap in research regarding the co-creation process and its effect on vaccination strategies.

              <p> To tackle these challenges, The PULSE Project is structured into four comprehensive work packages:</p>
              <ol> 
                <li> Evidence Review & Global Consultation: </li>
                  <ul> 
                  <li> We will conduct thorough literature reviews and engage in global consultations to understand current community engagement practices for vaccination in LMICs and humanitarian settings. </li>
                  <li> This includes mapping existing community engagement tools and strategies. </li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Field Evaluations in Nigeria </li>
                <ul>                   
                  <li>
                  Using qualitative research methods such as ethnography, interviews, and workshops, we will evaluate the actual implementation of community engagement and its influence on vaccine uptake.
                  </li>
              </ul>
                <li> Development of Tools & Community of Practice:</li>
                  <ul>
                    Our findings will lead to the creation of practical guidelines and a toolkit to support community-led vaccine deployment.
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                    We will launch a global community of practice to share insights, foster innovation, and disseminate best practices.

              <p> By the conclusion of the PULSE Project, we aim to have:</p><br>
              <li>
                Established a robust evidence base and agreed upon operational definitions for community engagement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed an evaluative framework for the co-creation of vaccine deployment strategies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Generated substantial evidence on innovative community engagement approaches.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created an active global community of practice to support and promote community-led vaccine strategies.
