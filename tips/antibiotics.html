                <br />
                <p>
                  Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin have made
                  age-old illnesses easily treatable. These &ldquo;wonder
                  drugs&rdquo; are wonderful &mdash; but only when used
                  properly. Improper use and overuse have made many drugs
                  ineffective because the bacteria they target have developed
                  resistance to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here&rsquo;s how to ensure that your child benefits from the
                  power of antibiotics.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>USING ANTIBIOTICS PROPERLY</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Ask your child&rsquo;s doctor about possible side effects of
                  antibiotics. When your child is prescribed a certain
                  medication, make sure you understand the proper dosage and in
                  what form (e.g., tablets, liquid) the medication will come.
                  Certain medications should not be taken with juice or milk.
                  Ask the pharmacist if you&rsquo;re not sure.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                  Before leaving the pharmacy, read the label to make sure the
                  instructions are the same as your doctor&rsquo;s. If not, ask
                  your pharmacist to double-check them. If you are unsure of
                  anything when you return home, call your doctor or pharmacist
                  right away.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                  Give only the exact amount of medication indicated by your
                  doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Use a specially marked medicine
                  spoon or cup to measure liquid doses. Kitchen spoons vary
                  widely in size, so if you use one, you could wind up under- or
                  overdosing your child. Medicine spoons, cups and syringes are
                  available at most pharmacies.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                  If you miss a dose, give it as soon as you remember it to help
                  keep a constant amount of medicine in your child&rsquo;s
                  blood. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip
                  the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.
                  Do not give 2 doses at once. Call your child&rsquo;s doctor if
                  2 or more doses are missed.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                  If your child vomits after taking medicine, do not repeat the
                  dose. Wait and give the next dose of medicine at the regular
                  time. If your child vomits again, call the doctor for
                  instructions.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                  Even if your child seems to feel better after a few days, keep
                  giving the medicine until it&rsquo;s all gone, unless
                  otherwise instructed by your doctor. It&rsquo;s important to
                  give the medicine for the full treatment time to be sure all
                  the bacteria that caused the infection have been killed.
                  Surviving bacteria not only can cause a relapse, but they also
                  may have developed resistance to the antibiotic, which they
                  can pass on to other bacteria, eventually rendering the drug
                  useless.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                  Never save unused medication for later use. Medications are
                  prescribed specifically for each child. It could be dangerous
                  or even fatal to give a prescription medication to a child it
                  was not intended for. If your child&rsquo;s doctor instructs
                  you to give the medication for only a specific number of days,
                  do not leave the unused medicine in the house. When the time
                  is up, throw the remaining medication away.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>ANTIBIOTIC OVERUSE</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Giving your child an antibiotic when she doesn&rsquo;t need
                  one can cause the antibiotic to be less effective in the
                  future. Asking your child&rsquo;s doctor for an antibiotic
                  prescription for his cold or viral illness may cause more harm
                  than good. Antibiotics are ineffective against viral
                  illnesses, and using them under these circumstances will help
                  create super-strains of germs that are much more of a
                  challenge to kill. This is called bacterial resistance.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                  When a sick child takes antibiotics too often &mdash; and for
                  the wrong reason &mdash;bacteria change form. That reduces or
                  eliminates the effectiveness of the medicine used to treat the
                  infection. The resistant bacteria survive, continue to
                  multiply and pass on their resistance to other bacteria. This
                  makes it harder for antibiotics to work the next time your
                  child is truly sick with a bacterial infection.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                  Overuse and misuse are 2 big reasons why bacteria have managed
                  to &ldquo;outsmart&rdquo; antibiotics.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                  Bacterial resistance is quickly becoming a widespread problem,
                  and it is one of the world&rsquo;s most pressing public health
                  concerns. Bacteria that were once highly responsive to
                  antibiotics have become increasingly resistant.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                  Among those that are becoming harder to treat are the germs
                  that cause pneumonia, urinary tract infections, middle ear
                  infections, skin infections and meningitis.
